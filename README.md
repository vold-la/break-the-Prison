# break-the-prison
It is simple game where the avatar is a prisoner and he has to collect tools, if he strikes with torch light\
then prison wall gets broader on each strike and at final point when he has no place to move then his body \
gets ripped off. Also he if he collects explosive then the wall get a bit narrower.\
The controls are,if user press on screen then the avatar will move to right and on release it will move to left of screen. \

The graphics are not that good at the moment since I made it in hurry.\
ToDO-improve graphics and sounds,create story.
